## Getting Started

### Environment Variables

For fetching your articles from dev.to, create an `.env.local` file inside the project directory. Check the `.env.local.example` file for more information.

### Running Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result, you can also make changes while the server is running, no need to restart UNLESS you add changes on files/folders like `/public` or `next.config.js` .

### Things to have in mind
All VSCode related components can be found in the `components` folder. To change the content of the portfolio, check out the `pages` folder. To add or remove pages, modify `components/Sidebar.jsx` and `components/Tabsbar.jsx`.

After working with this portfolio, there are some things to mention for the people who are new working with these kinds of templates:

- This portfolio was created mostly for web developers to use, so if you want tags in the `pages/projects.jsx` that are outside the normal webdev tags, you'd have to create them in `styles/globals.css`.

- The images in `pages/projects.jsx` are not local, to add your own, you'd have to add the domain to `next.config.js` and normally add the link of it in `pages/api/projects.json`.

- To use the `pages/articles.jsx` tabs, you'd have to uncomment them and use [dev.to's](https://dev.to/) API to retrieve your articles.

- For the contact form in `pages/contact.jsx` you need a Notion workspace with a database. The database must have 4 properties: `Name`, `Email`, `Subject` and `Message`. You can find the links to Notion's docs in `.env.local.example`.

### Deploy on Vercel


The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

## Next.js Resources

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/)
